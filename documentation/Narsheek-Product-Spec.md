# Narsheek — Updated Product Spec

## BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)
Narsheek is a browser extension that lets users preview and manage all their open tabs through a side panel opened with a keyboard shortcut. The core feature is that hovering over any tab in the list instantly previews and loads that page in the main browser window, allowing users to see the tab’s content without fully switching context. Once they move their mouse away, they return to their original tab unless they click to switch. This minimizes mental context switching and keeps the user’s focus intact.

## Problem Statement
Modern web users often juggle dozens of open tabs, creating constant friction in focus and navigation. Finding the right tab usually requires scanning tiny favicons or page titles, leading to repetitive context switching and wasted time. Even when a tab is located, users lack an easy way to visually confirm its content without fully switching, breaking their flow. On top of this, tab organization remains clumsy: users can’t quickly group related tabs for context, nor can they easily see whether a tab is already bookmarked or save it on the spot if it isn’t. Each of these tasks—locating, previewing, bookmarking, and grouping—requires multiple clicks, excess mouse travel, and constant back-and-forth across the browser UI. The result is scattered attention, broken concentration, and unnecessary cognitive load that slows users down and diminishes productivity.

## Goals
- Make hover-to-preview the main interaction for tab management.  
- Ensure users can easily return to their original tab unless they explicitly click to switch.  
- Integrate grouping and bookmarking directly into the hover-based workflow.  
- Focus on a smooth, intuitive user experience that minimizes workflow interruptions.  

## Non-Goals
Narsheek is not intended to replace core browser features. While it enhances tab management with lightweight tools, it will not attempt to fully replicate or overhaul existing systems. Specifically:

1. **Tab performance management** — Narsheek will not handle tab memory offloading, suspension, or background resource optimization. These remain browser-level responsibilities.  
2. **Full-featured bookmarking and reading systems** — Narsheek will not replace native bookmarks, Reading List, or other per-tab features (like history, sharing, or annotations). Instead, it only provides lightweight add-ons (e.g., quick bookmarking, “already bookmarked” visibility) to improve focus and reduce friction.  
3. **Core browser workflows** — features like syncing bookmarks across devices, deep folder management, or advanced reading/annotation tools remain out of scope. Narsheek complements these systems but does not compete with them.
